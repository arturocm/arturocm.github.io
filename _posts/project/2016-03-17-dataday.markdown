####Mapping Census Data in R <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/censuscourse" target="_blank">#censuscourse</a>

<p>This is a simple shiny app that lets you select between 
different variables from the df_state_demographics data frame. You can also play with the argument num_colors from the state_choropleth formula to see how the color intensity changes</p>

<p>On the HW2 tab we need to create a choropleth of some other demographic statistic in 
the data.frame df_county_demographics.</p>

<p>On the HW3 tab we create a choropleth - zoomed at the county level - for demographic statistic available in the data.frame df_zip_demographics. For this we'll use the formula zip_choropleth(). Also, Shiny gives 
us the advantage we can cross-reference the FIPS code list from
