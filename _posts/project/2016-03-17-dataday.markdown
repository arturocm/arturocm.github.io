####Phantom Inventory: The "Hello World" of Retail Analytics

<p>I was invited as a speaker to give a Retail Analtyics presentation 
during the 2016 Software Guru Data Day</p>

<p>This was a great experience to get to know fellow Mexican data enthusiasts...
and some of them truly data scientists!</p>

<p>The presentation was made using Google I/O 2012 HTML5 Slide Deck as a template</p>
